/**
 * @brief Repeat an operation on every element of a 3D grid.
 *
 * Intermediate values that depend on the iterated coordinates
 * are calculated and stored once per iteration. This is useful
 * when the operation is costly.
 *
 * @param start       Initial values for the loop counters.
 * @param stop        Final values (one-past-the-end) for the loop counters.
 * @param counters    Loop counters.
 * @param kernel      Functor to execute.
 * @param projector   Projection of the current loop counter.
 * @tparam Kernel     Nullary function.
 * @tparam Projector  Binary function that takes a nesting depth and a loop
 *                    counter as arguments and projects a value.
